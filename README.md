# Decentralized-Voting-System
🗳️ Decentralized Voting Smart Contract


📌 Project Overview:

This project implements a Simple Decentralized Voting System using Solidity.
It allows an owner to add candidates, enables users to vote securely (only once), and determines the winner after the voting period ends.



📁 Project Structure:

├── DecentralizedVoting.sol
├── README.md


🚀 Deployment Steps;

1).Open Remix IDE 
2).Create a new file Voting.sol
3).Paste the smart contract code
4).Compile using Solidity ^0.8.0
5).Deploy with constructor parameter:
      `_votingDurationInMinutes (e.g., 10)`
6).Interact with deployed contract using Remix UI


🛡️The contract demonstrates core Solidity fundamentals such as:-

      Structs
      Mappings
      Events
      Modifiers
      Access control
      Basic security practices 



🎯 Objective:

To build a decentralized voting smart contract that:

  Prevents double voting
  Ensures only valid candidates receive votes
  Restricts administrative actions to the owner
  Determines the winner transparently after voting ends



⚙️ Tech Stack:

    Solidity ^0.8.0
    Remix IDE
    Ethereum Testnet (Sepolia / Goerli)




📜 Smart Contract Features:

✅ Candidate Management
Owner can add candidates
Each candidate has:
                   ` name`
                   ` voteCount`
✅ Voting System
Any address can vote
Each address can vote only once
Voting is allowed only before the deadline
Emits events for transparency
  
✅ Winner Selection
After voting ends, the candidate with the highest votes is returned
In case of a tie, the first candidate with max votes wins



🧠 Contract Functions:

| Function                     | Description                        |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `addCandidate(string _name)` | Adds a new candidate (Owner only)  |
| `vote(uint _candidateId)`    | Vote for a candidate               |
| `getCandidateCount()`        | Returns total number of candidates |
| `getCandidate(uint _id)`     | Returns candidate name and votes   |
| `getWinner()`                | Returns winning candidate details  |



📡 Deployment Details:

Network: Sepolia / Goerli Testnet
Deployment Address: <<Add your deployed contract address here>>
Etherscan Link: <<Paste Etherscan link here>>


⛽ Gas Usage (Observed):

addCandidate() → Low gas (simple storage)
vote() → Optimized, single state update
getWinner() → View function, no gas when called externally

To run the code, you need to run the following commands. 

```shell
npm install
```

You first need to compile the contract and upload it to the blockchain network. Run the following commands to compile and upload the contract.


```shell
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat run --network volta scripts/deploy.js
```

Once the contract is uploaded to the blockchain, copy the contract address and copy it in the .env file. 
You can also use another blockchain by writing the blockchain's endpoint in hardhat-config. 

Once you have pasted your private key and contract address in the .env file, simply run command 

```shell
node index.js
```

and go to http://localhost:3000 to interact with the decentralized voting application.

You can also run command
            'npm run dev'


🧩 Challenges & Solutions :- 

Challenge: Preventing double voting
Solution: Used `mapping(address => bool)` to track voter participation

Challenge: Ensuring voting fairness
Solution: Implemented a voting deadline using ` block.timestamp`



📌 Conclusion:
This project demonstrates a secure and transparent decentralized voting mechanism using Solidity. It follows smart contract best practices and fulfills all assignment requirements.
